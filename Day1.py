# print( what to print) function --> output 
# double quotes-text to print
#Strings-pearl necklace, string of characters 

print("Hello World")

#print("Hello world!)

# String Manipulation 

print("Hello world!\nHello world!\nHello world!")

# Concatenate Strings- combine different strings to be added to another string 
# use the + to combine 2 strings
#Think of strings as connected characters 
# taking seperate strings and merging them into 1

print("Hello" + "Amina")
#print("Hello " + "Amina")
#print("Hello" + " Amina")
print("Hello" + " " "Amina")

# Coding in Python-be careful with spaces or tabs inserted
   #Indentation Error 
 #print("Hello world!")

# Python Input Function- input("prompt for the user") 
input("What is your name? ")

# What is your name and when I input name enter -the input is replaced by name and then concatenated to Hello and it all gets printed
#print("Hello" + input("What is your name? "))

# Variables 
# Assigns whatever user inputs as name
# We saved the data and used name as a variable 
# It's like having a phone number in your phone book but no name. 
# If we ever need it, we can refer to it as a variable
# Can be changed or varied 

#name = input("What is your name?")
#print(name)

name = "Jackie"
print(name)

name = "Amina"
print(name)

# print(len(input("What is your name?"))) 
name = input("What is your name?") # Name is what the user set
length = len(name) # variable to set the legnth 
print(length)


# Naming Variables -make your code readable- it makes sense 
# No spaces in a variable -one unit, use _ to seperate or numbers(at the end)
# Don't use functions as names for variables- bad practice 

n = "Muna"
print(name)

user_name = "Muna"
print(user_name)

name1 = "Amina"
